A public repository for every previous version of the Project: Evolution series of script hubs

# V1
This was my first attempt at a 'proper' hub, it's written like shit cause I was really shit back then.

Give or take, 3 years old

# V2
Quality-wise, not much better than V1. A bunch more features tho, this was the hub in the series that took off with a significant amount of popularity

1 - 2 years old

# V3
Better, much more structurally sound and has some better methodology behind the functions. By no means 'good', but certainly a lot better than the average Roblox hub

2 - 8 months old
